# New-Mind-AI-Bootcamp-Final-Case
Patika.dev &amp; New Mind
This project was developed as part of the Patika.dev & NewMind AI Bootcamp capstone. It focuses on leveraging machine learning and NLP models to analyze, categorize, summarize, and expand news articles efficiently.
## üöÄ Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of processing large volumes of news articles by providing a streamlined solution for:

**Categorization**: Classifying articles into predefined categories like Business, Technology, Sports, Education, and Entertainment.

**Summarization**: Generating concise summaries for each article using BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers).

**Text Generation**: Expanding on articles to provide more informative and engaging content using DistilGPT-2.

## üß∞ Key Features
**Category Prediction**: Using machine learning models like XGBoost, articles are classified into their respective categories.

**Summarization**: Leveraging Hugging Face's BART model for high-quality and context-aware article summaries.

**Text Expansion**: Using GPT-2 to expand articles with additional context and details.

**Performance Metrics**: The project evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROUGE, and BLEU.

**Streamlit Application**: An interactive interface for users to input articles and view predictions, summaries, and expanded texts.
